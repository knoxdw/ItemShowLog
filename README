ItemShowLog is the simple beginning of a plugin to create a log of each time an item is shown in public view. 

The plugin began as an exercise at the plugin track of the Omeka Playdate held on May 21, 2010 at the Center for History and New Media at George Mason University. Patrick Murray-John pair-programmed with Douglas Knox with the help of Omeka developers Jim Safley and Will Riley.
